Statistical significance is calculated using a p value, which tells you the probability of your result being observed, given that a certain statement (the null hypothesis) is true. If this p-value is less than the significance level set (usually 0.05), the experimenter can assume that the null hypothesis is false and accept the alternative hypothesis. Using a simple t-test, you can calculate a p-value and determine significance between two different groups of a dataset."
